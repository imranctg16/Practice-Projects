An **EXPERIMENTAL** Webpack plugin to enable "Fast Refresh" (also known as _Hot Reloading_) for React components.

> This plugin is not 100% stable.
> We're hoping to land a v1 release soon - please help us by reporting any issues you've encountered!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you are using at least the minimum supported versions of this plugin's peer dependencies -
older versions unfortunately do not contain code to orchestrate "Fast Refresh",
and thus cannot be made compatible.

We recommend using the following versions:

| Dependency      | Version                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `react`         | `16.13.0`+, `17.x` or `18.x` |
| `react-dom`     | `16.13.0`+, `17.x` or `18.x` |
| `react-refresh` | `0.10.0`+                    |
| `webpack`       | `4.46.0`+ or `5.2.0`+        |
